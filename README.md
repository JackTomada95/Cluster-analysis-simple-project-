# Cluster-analysis-simple-project-
Cluster analysis and Dimensionality reduction for data visualization

In this (simple) project I want conduct a cluster analysis on the "crime dataset".
This dataset was provided by the university of Muenster (Germany) to make us do some practice with k-means clustering.
I will also test the other clustering techniques (Hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN), visualize the data and evaluate performance.
In the end, I will try to interpret the results.
